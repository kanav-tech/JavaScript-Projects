# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains all JavaScript projects, coding challenges, and assignments completed during my course.

Each folder inside this repository will contain a different assignment or project, organized by topic or lesson.

I will regularly push updates here as I complete more exercises and receive feedback from my instructor.

Thank you for reviewing my work!
